SFML test

## Controls:
- **WASD:** Camera movement
- **Scroll Wheel:** Zoom
- **Q/E:** Adjust seeker range
- **R:** Generate a random target point
- **Left Shift:** Increase action speed


## Compiling or something
- ngl i have no clue just compile it on x64 release in vs2022
- ! also if you don't copy the `assets` folder into `x64\release` when built then just go into `definitions.hpp` and set `DEBUG` to `false` !
